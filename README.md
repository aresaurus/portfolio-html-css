# portfolio-html-css
Portfolio project using HTML &amp; CSS.
The design follows a Mobile-First approach by means of media queries.

The portfolio consists of a fixed navigation bar for desktop displays with internal links to the portfolio sections, a main section for the title and an image, a brief About me section, a Skills section with animated progress bars and a contact form with some text inputs and radio buttons, plus a message box and a submit button.
